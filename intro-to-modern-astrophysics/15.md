## 15. The Fate of Massive Stars

### Post-main-sequence evolution:

| $M\;(M_\odot)$ | path to supernova            |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- |
| $\gtrsim85$    | O →  Of → LBV → WN → WC → SN |
| $40\sim85$     | O →  Of →  WN → WC → SN      |
| $25\sim40$     | O → RSG →  WN → WC → SN      |
| $20\sim25$     | o → RSG →  WN → SN           |
| $10\sim20$     | O → RSG → BSG → SN           |

* **Luminous blue variables** (LBVs; prototype: S Doradus):
  massive stars whose brightness suddenly erupt from time to time
  * Effective temperatures between 15,000~30,000 K, masses $\gtrsim 85 M_\odot$,
    and luminosities $\gtrsim10^6 L_\odot$ approaching the Eddington limit
  * Possible mechanisms behind behavior include
    envelope mass loss from temporarily exceeding Eddington limit,
    atmospheric pulsation instabilities, and binary companions
* **Wolf–Rayet stars** (WR):
  very hot, rapidly rotating stars with unusually strong broad emission lines and high mass loss
  * Effective temperatures between 25,000~100,000 K, masses $\gtrsim 20 M_\odot$,
    mass loss rates $\gtrsim 10^{-5} M_\odot/\text{year}$, and equatorial rotation speed ~300 km/s
  * Atypical spectral composition due to mass loss progressive stripping away outermost layers:
    WNs emission lines dominate in He and N; WCs in He and C; WOs in O
* Blue supergiants (BSG)
* Red supergiants (RSG)
  * Humphreys–Davidson luminosity limit: the most massive stars never evolve to RSG portion
    due to max luminosity cutoff
* Of stars: O supergiants with pronounced emission lines

### Supernovae

* Recorded Milky Way supernovae:
  SN 1006, SN 1054 with Crab supernova remnant,
  Tycho’s supernova SN 1572, and Kepler’s supernova SN 1604
* SN 1987A: first nearby supernova in age of modern astronomy
  * Occurred in Large Magellanic Clouds, 50 kpc from Earth
    *
* Classifications:
  * Type I: no H lines
    * Ia: Si II lines
    * Ib/Ic: no Si II lines
      * Ib: He lines
      * Ic: no He lines
  * Type II: H lines
    * II-P: plateau
    * II-L: linear
