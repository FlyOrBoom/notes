## 16. The Degenerate Remnants of Stars

### White dwarfs (WDs)

* Manufactured in cores of low- and intermediate-mass stars ($M_\text{ZAMS}\lesssim8M_\odot$)
* Low luminosity despite high central temperature indicate lack of fuel for thermonuclear reaction
* Primarily comprises completedly ionized C and O nuclei, but extreme gravity stratifies interior into CO core ) He layer ) H layer over $\sim100$ years
* $0.4\sim0.7M_\odot$, $\sim R_\oplus$, $5000\sim80\,000$ K
* Interior nearly isothermal due to energy transfer via highly efficient, degenerate **electron conduction**; steep temperature drop in nondegenerate envelope drive convection mixing in surface layers 
* Thermal energy primarily resides in kinetic energy of nuclei, as nearly all electrons are in degenerate energy levels
* Core cools at $T_\text{core}(t) = T_0\left(1+{5\over2}{t\over\tau_0}\right)^{-2/5}$
  * Luminosity $L\propto T_\text{core}^{7/2} \propto T_\text{eff}^4$: interior cools faster than surface
  * At $\sim10^{-4}L_\odot$, nuclei begin crystallizing, slowing cooling
* Spectral lines significantly broadened due extreme pressure near surface
* Spectral type D (dwarf)
  * **PNN**: planetary nebula nuclei, birth of WD
  * **DO**: mid-transition from around O type to WD stage
  * **DA**: only H absorption lines; $\sim70\%$ of population
  * **DB**: only He absorption lines; $\sim8\%$ of population
  * **DC**: featureless continuum; $\sim14\%$ of population
  * **DQ**: additional C lines
  * **DZ**: additional metal lines
  * Convective mixing may transform WD between spectral subtypes
* **Pulsating white dwarfs**: on instability strip with periods of $100\sim1000$ s  
  * Multiple periods with $3\sim125$ different simultaneous frequencies
  * Nonradial g-modes resonating in H and He layers cause surface temperature variations without much effect on radius
  * **DAV stars** (prototype: ZZ Ceti): $T_\text{eff}\approx12\;000$ K; resonance driven by H partial ionization zone
  * **DBV stars**: $T_\text{eff}\approx27\;000$ K; resonance driven by He partial ionization zone
  * **DOV** and **PNNV** stars: $T_\text{eff}\approx10^5$ K

### Degenerate matter

* Degeneracy of electron fermion gas responsible for maintaining hydrostatic equilibrium in white dwarfs
* **Fermion gas**: Obeying the Pauli exclusion principle, only one particle is allowed per state
  * At $T = 0$ K, all energy states below the **Fermi energy** $\varepsilon_F = {\hbar^2\over2m} (3\pi^2n)^{2/3}$ are occupied and the fermion gas is fully degenerate
  * For $T > 0$ K, fermion gases are still approximately degenerate if average thermal energy ${3\over2}kT < \varepsilon_F$; for an electron gas, ${T\over\rho^{2/3}}<1261$ K m$^2$ kg$^{-2/3}$
* Nonrelativistic **degeneracy pressure** $P = {(3\pi^2)^{2/3}\over5} {\hbar^2\over m} n^{5/3}$
  * Dynamically stable: $P\propto \rho^\gamma$ where adiabatic index $\gamma={5\over3}$
  * Yields nonrelativistic **massâ€“volume relation**: $V\propto {1\over M}$ and $\rho\propto M^2$
  * Largely temperature independent, leading to He flash in degenerate cores
* As $v_e\to c$ at high $M$, adiabatic index $\gamma\to{4\over3}$ and WD becomes dynamically unstable
* **Chandrasekhar limit**: maximum mass $M_\text{Ch}\approx0.44M_\odot$
