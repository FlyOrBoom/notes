## 18. Closed Binary Star Systems

### Gravity

* Large majority of stars are in multi-star systems, but most of them are **detached binaries**: sufficiently far apart ($a\gg\max(R_1, R_2)$) to evolve independently
* In close systems ($a\lesssim\max(R_1,R_2)$), tidal forces induce pulsation, dissipating orbital and rotational energy until tidal lock is achieved
* In corotating center-of-mass reference frame, effective gravitational potential $\Phi=-G\left({M_1\over s_1}+{M_2\over s_2}\right)-{\omega^2r^2\over 2}$
  * Where $s_1$ and $s_2$ are distances to the two masses, and angular frequence $\omega={G(M_1+M_2)\over a^3}$
* Hydrostatic equilibrium ensures constant pressure and density along **equipotential surfaces**; expanding stars fill successively larger ones
* Gravitational and centrifugal forces balance at **Lagragian points**, where $\vec F=-m\nabla\Phi=0$
  * Local minima are stable; local maxima and saddle-points are unstable
* Inner Lagrangian point $L_1$ located between the masses with distances to each $\lbrace \ell_1, \ell_2 \rbrace \approx a\left({1\over2}\pm0.227\log_{10}{M_1\over M_2}\right)$
  * Equipotential surfaces meet at $L_1$ as teardrop-shaped **Roche lobes**
* **Semidetached binary**: secondary star (with $M_2$ not necessarily more massive) fills its Roche lobe and loses mass to the companion primary star
* **Contact binary**: both stars fill (or even expand beyond) their Roche lobes and share a common atmosphere
* **Mass transfer rate** $\dot M\approx\pi R\rho d\sqrt{3kT\over m_\text{H}}$
  * Where $R$ is maximum Roche lobe radius and $d$ is overfill distance
* Infalling material release $\dot E={GM\dot M\over R}$, or $\sim20\%$ of rest mass in energy when falling into neutron stars, compared to $\lesssim1\%$ falling into white dwarfs

### Accretion disks

* If primary star of semidetached binary has radius $r\lesssim0.05a$, mass stream from secondary will miss its surface and enter orbit at $r_0=a\left(\ell_1\over a\right)^4\left(1+{M_2\over M_1}\right)$
* Accretion disk develops; further mass stream impacts at disk **hot spot**
* Viscosity converts orbital kinetic energy into random thermal motion, causing disk mass to inspiral and eventually fall to surface
  * Source of strong viscosity poorly understood; possibly convection turbulence or magnetohydrodynamic instabilities
* Radius $R_\text{disk}\approx2r_0$ due to conservation of angular momentum: most disk material spiral inward while some spiral outward 
* Temperature $T_\text{disk}(r)=T_\text{0}\sqrt[4]{\left(R\over r\right)^3 \left(1-\sqrt{R-r}\right) }$
  * Where characteric temperature $T_0\equiv\sqrt[4]{3GM\dot M\over 8\pi\sigma R^3}\approx 2\max(T)$
* Luminosity $L_\text{disk}={GM\dot M\over 2R}={1\over2}\dot E$, with the other half delivered to the primary star
  * White dwarf $L_\text{disk}\approx0.22\,L_\odot$, emitting primarily in UV
  * Neutron star $L_\text{disk}\approx2400\,L_\odot$, emitting primarily in X-ray
