# Dodelson & Schmidt: Modern Cosmology

[Xing’s notes](/notes/). I try to fill in the details of some derivations that the textbook skips for brevity, 
and explain the conceptual intuition behind some formulas that the textbook takes as granted. 
No guarantees when I’ll finish the whole thing.
Deepest thanks to Chien-I Chiang and Ori Ganor for teaching me the prerequisite knowledge for tackling cosmology (namely, Lagrangian mechanics and general relativity), 
and for patiently answering my questions wherever I got stuck on this subject.
