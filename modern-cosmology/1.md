## 1. The concordance model of cosmology

The expansion of the universe is the expansion of space itself. This is parameterized by the **scale factor** $a(t)$ such that the **physical distance** between objects is $d=ax$, where $x$ is the **comoving distance**. The present-day scale factor $a(t_0)$ is defined to be 1.
