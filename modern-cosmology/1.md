## 1. The concordance model of cosmology

The expansion of the universe is the expansion of space *itself*: at the largest scales, objects are physically drifting farther apart because the grid markings are, in a sense, becoming denser. We parameterize this with the **scale factor** $a(t)$ such that the **physical distance** between objects is $d\equiv ax$, where $x$ is the **comoving distance**. This allows the physical velocities of (non-relativistic) objects to be separated into $v = \dot ax + a\dot x$, where the first term is due to the expansion of space, and the second term is due to a **peculiar velocity** of the object. 

The effect of expansion is most apparent in the **cosmological redshift** of photons. Defining the present-day scale factor $a(t_0)=1$, it can be related to the redshift parameter $z$ via $1 + z \equiv \frac{\lambda_\text{obs}}{\lambda_\text{emit}} = \frac1{a_\text{emit}}$. Through black-body radiation, it can also be related to temperature via $T(t) = \frac{T(t_0)}{a(t)}$.

The **Hubble rate** $H(t) \equiv \frac{\dot a}{a}$ measures the rapidity of expansion, with the present-day Hubble rate $H_0 \equiv H(t_0)$ referred to as **Hubbleâ€™s constant**. From the Friedmann equation, $H(t)^2 \propto \rho(t) + \frac1{a(t)^2}(\rho_c - \rho(t_0))$, where $\rho$ is the average density of the universe, and $\rho_c$ is the **critical density** at which the universe is flat.

Due to tensions in measurements of $H_0$, we parameterize it with a dimensionless number $h$ such that $H_0 \equiv 100\, h$ km/s/Mpc, with $h\approx 0.7$. This way, $H_0$ can be eliminated from calculations by using Mpc/$h$ as the unit of length, $M_\odot/h$ as the unit of mass, etc.

The $\Lambda$CDM model is the **concordance model of cosmology**, describing a flat universe which grew out of inflationary perturbations, and is presently dominanted by cold dark matter (CDM) and the cosmological constant $\Lambda$.
