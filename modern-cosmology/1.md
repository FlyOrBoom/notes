## 1. The concordance model of cosmology

The expansion of the universe is the expansion of space *itself*: at the largest scales, objects are physically drifting farther apart because the grid markings are, in a sense, becoming denser. We parameterize this with the **scale factor** $a=a(t)$ such that the **physical distance** between objects is $d\equiv ax$, where $x$ is the **comoving distance**. This allows the physical velocities of (non-relativistic) objects to be separated into 
\\[
v \equiv \dot d = \dot ax + a\dot x,
\\] 
where the first term is due to the expansion of space, and the second term is due to a **peculiar velocity** of the object. 

The physical distance $d$ is what gets measured directly by light, through its travel time or (more commonly) its flux’s inverse-square relation.
The comoving distance $x$ is determined indirectly, but remains constant ($\dot x = 0$) for objects that do not interact, gravitationally, electrormagnetically, or otherwise.

The effect of expansion is most apparent in the **cosmological redshift** of photons. Defining the present-day scale factor $a(t\_0)=1$, it can be related to the redshift parameter $z$ via 
\\[
1 + z(t) \equiv \frac{\lambda(t\_0)}{\lambda(t)} = \frac1{a(t)}. 
\tag{1.1}
\\]
Through black-body radiation, it can also be related to temperature via $T(t) = T(t\_0) / a(t)$.

The **Hubble rate** $H(t) \equiv \dot a/a$ measures the rapidity of expansion, with the present-day Hubble rate $H\_0 \equiv H(t\_0)$ referred to as **Hubble’s constant**. From the Friedmann equation, 
\\[
\frac{H(t)^2}{8\pi G} = \rho(t) + \frac{\rho_{\text{cr}} - \rho(t\_0)}{a(t)^2},
\tag{1.3}
\\] 
where $\rho$ is the average density of the universe, and
\\[
\rho_{\text{cr}} \equiv \frac{3H\_0^2}{8\pi G}
\tag{1.4}
\\]
is the **critical density** at which the universe is flat.

Due to tensions in measurements of $H\_0$, we parameterize it with a dimensionless number $h$ such that $H\_0 \equiv 100\, h$ km/s/Mpc, with $h\sim 0.7$. This way, $H\_0$ can be eliminated from calculations by using $h^{-1}$ Mpc as the unit of length, $h^{-1}\, M_\odot$ as the unit of mass, etc.

The ΛCDM model is the **concordance model of cosmology**, describing a flat universe which grew out of inflationary perturbations, and is presently dominanted by cold dark matter (CDM) and the cosmological constant $\Lambda$.
