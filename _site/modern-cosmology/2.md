### Geodesics and the FLRW metric

According to general relativity, particles in the absence of any forces move in **geodesics** such that
in Minkowski coordinates,
\\[
\f{\d ^2 x^\alpha}{\d \lambda^2} = 0
\tag{2.13}
\\]
for some parameter $\lambda$ that monotonically increases along the particle’s path (such as proper time for massive particles).
However, this equation does not necessarily hold true for other coordinate systems, where the basis vectors are not invariant over spacetime.
Under a change of coordinates from Minkowski $x^\alpha\mapsto x^{\nu'}$, the geodesic equation becomes
\\[\begin{aligned}
0 &= \f{\d }{\d \lambda} \f{\d  x^{\nu'}}{\d \lambda} \\\
&= \f{\d }{\d \lambda}\prn{  \f{\p x^{\nu'}}{\p x^{\alpha}} \f{\d  x^{\alpha}}{\d \lambda}  } \\\
&= \f{\d  x^\alpha}{\d \lambda} \f{\d }{\d \lambda} \f{\p x^{\nu'}}{\p x^\alpha} + \underline{
\f{\p x^{\nu'}}{\p x^\alpha} \f{\d ^2 x^\alpha}{\d \lambda^2}
}\_{\displaystyle\star} \\\
&= \f{\d  x^\alpha}{\d \lambda} \f{\p}{\p x^\alpha}\f{\d x^{\nu'}}{\d \lambda} +
\star\\\
&= \f{\d  x^\alpha}{\d \lambda} \f{\p}{\p x^\alpha}\prn{  \f{\p x^{\nu'}}{\p x^\beta}\f{\d x^\beta}{\d \lambda}  } + \star\\\
&= \f{\d  x^\alpha}{\d \lambda} \brk{  \f{\p^2 x^{\nu'}}{\p x^\alpha \p x^\beta}\f{\d x^\beta}{\d \lambda} + \f{\p x^{\nu'}}{\p x^\beta} \underline{\f{\d }{\d \lambda}\prn{\f{\p x^\beta}{\p x^\alpha}}}\_0 } +
\star\\\
&= \f{\p^2 x^{\nu'}}{\p x^\alpha \p x^\beta}\f{\d x^\alpha}{\d \lambda}\f{\d  x^\beta}{\d \lambda} +
\f{\p x^{\nu'}}{\p x^\alpha} \f{\d ^2 x^\alpha}{\d \lambda^2}.
\tag{2.18}
\end{aligned}\\]
Applying the inverse transform $x^{\nu'}\mapsto x^\mu$ to both sides yields
\\[
0 = \underbrace{\f{\p x^\mu}{\p x^{\nu'}} \f{\p^2 x^{\nu'}}{\p x^\alpha \p x^\beta}}
\_{\displaystyle \Gamma^\mu\_{\alpha\beta}} \f{\d x^\alpha}{\d \lambda}\f{\d  x^\beta}{\d \lambda} +
 \f{\d ^2 x^{\mu}}{\d \lambda^2},
 \tag{2.19}
\\]
where $\Gamma^\mu\_{\alpha\beta}$ is the **Christoffel symbol**, related to the metric by
\\[
\Gamma^\mu\_{\alpha\beta} = \f{g^{\mu\nu}}{2}
\left[
\p\_\beta g\_{\alpha\nu} +
\p\_\alpha g\_{\beta\nu} -
\p\_\nu g\_{\alpha\beta}
\right].
\tag{2.21}
\\]
The **geodesic equation** which holds true for all coordinate systems is therefore
\\[
\f{\d^2 x^\mu}{\d\lambda^2} = -\Gamma^\mu\_{\alpha\beta} \f{\d x^\alpha}{\d\lambda} \f{\d x^\beta}{\d\lambda}.
\\]

The Christoffel symbol is used in defining the **covariant derivative** $\nabla\_\mu$:
\\[\begin{aligned}
\text{scalar} && \nabla\_\mu\phi &\equiv \p\_\mu\phi,\\\
\text{vector} && \nabla\_\mu A^\nu &\equiv \p\_\mu A^\nu + \Gamma^\nu\_{\mu\alpha} A^\alpha,\\\
\text{tensor} && \nabla\_\mu {T\_\nu}^\kappa &\equiv \p\_\mu {T\_\nu}^\kappa - \Gamma^\lambda\_{\mu\nu}{T\_\lambda}^\kappa + \Gamma^\kappa\_{\mu\lambda}{T\_\nu}^\lambda.
\tag{2.52}
\end{aligned}\\]
This is necessary because the partial derivative $\p\_\mu$ only transforms covariantly when acting on scalars. For instance, the geodesic equation can be rewritten in covariant form as 
\\[
\f{\d x^\alpha}{\d \lambda} \nabla\_\alpha \f{\d x^\mu}{\d \lambda} = 0.
\tag{2.53}
\\]

In the flat, expanding ΛCDM universe, distances in spacetime are described with the Euclidean **Friedmann--Lamaître--Robertson--Walker (FLRW) metric**
\\[
g\_{\mu\nu} \to \begin{pmatrix}
-1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\
0 & a^2 & 0 & 0\\\
0 & 0 & a^2 & 0\\\
0 & 0 & 0 & a^2
\end{pmatrix},
\tag{2.12}
\\]
with the inverse (contravariant) metric
\\[
g^{\mu\nu} \to \begin{pmatrix}
-1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\
0 & a^{-2} & 0 & 0\\\
0 & 0 & a^{-2} & 0\\\
0 & 0 & 0 & a^{-2}
\end{pmatrix}
\\]
satisfying the identity $g^{\nu\beta}g\_{\beta\alpha} = \delta^\nu\_\alpha$.

The FLRW metric is independent of the spatial coordinates ($\p\_i$) as a consequence of spatial isotropy and homogeneity,
but dependent on time ($\p\_0$) due to the $a^2$ expansion terms.
Its Christoffel symbol is thus
\\[\begin{aligned}
\Gamma^0\_{ij} &= \f{g^{0\nu}}{2}
\left[
\zero{ \p\_j g\_{i\nu} } +
\zero{ \p\_i g\_{j\nu} } -
\p\_0 g\_{ij}
\right] \\\
&= -\f{g^{00}}2\p\_0 g\_{ij}
= \delta\_{ij} a\dot a, \\\
\Gamma^i\_{j0} = \Gamma^i\_{0j} &= \f{g^{i\nu}}{2}
\left[
\p\_0 g\_{j\nu} +
\zero{ \p\_j g\_{0\nu} } -
\zero{ \p\_\nu g\_{j0} }
\right] \\\
&= \delta^{i\nu}a^{-2}\delta\_{j\nu}a\dot a
= \delta^i\_j\f{\dot a}a, \\\
\Gamma^\alpha\_{00} &= \Gamma^0\_{\alpha0} = \Gamma^0\_{0\alpha} = \Gamma^i\_{jk} = 0.
\tag{2.25}
\end{aligned}\\]
Verify for yourself that these equations together resolve every entry of the symbol.

### Energy and momentum of a particle

We wish to calculate the effects of cosmic expansion on the energy of a free particle.

If we choose to parameterize a massive particle’s path by $\lambda = \tau/m$, 
where $\tau$ is the particle’s proper time, then we can write the particle’s **comoving momentum** as 
\\[
P^\alpha 
= m\f{\d x^\alpha}{\d\tau}
= \f{\d x^\alpha}{\d\lambda}.
\tag{2.26}
\\]
We write the same for a massless particle by setting $\lambda = \nu t$,
where $\nu$ is the particle’s de Broglie frequency.

For a free particle, $P^0$ is conserved along its geodesic. 
We identify this as the particle’s energy $E$, so
\\[
\f{\d }{\d \lambda} = \f{\d x^0}{\d \lambda}\f{\d}{\d x^0} = E\f{\d}{\d t}.
\tag{2.27}
\\]

In the rest frame of the particle, $E = m$ while $P^i = 0$, giving the FLRW **dispersion relation**
\\[
g\_{\mu\nu}P^\mu P^\nu = -E^2 + \delta\_{ij} a^2 P^i P^j = -m^2.
\tag{2.29}
\\]
This motivates defining
\\[
\vec p^i = a P^i
\tag{2.32}
\\]
as the **physical momentum** $\vec p$ of the particle, 
since it satisifies the Minkowskian dispersion relation
$-E^2 + \delta\_{ij} p^i p^j = m^2$.

The geodesic equation for the particle thus simplifies as
\\[\begin{aligned}
\f{\d ^2 x^\mu}{\d \lambda^2} 
&= -\Gamma^\mu\_{\alpha\beta} \f{\d x^\alpha}{\d \lambda} \f{\d x^\beta}{\d \lambda} \\\
= \f{\d P^\mu}{\d \lambda}= E\dot P^\mu
&= -\Gamma^\mu\_{ij} P^i P^j,
\end{aligned}\\]
with the $\mu=0$ component
\\[\begin{aligned}
E\dot E &= -\Gamma^0\_{ij} P^i P^j \\\
&= -a\dot a \delta\_{ij} P^i P^j\\\
&= \f{\dot a}{a} \big[m^2 - E^2\big].
\end{aligned}\\]

For a massless particle, 
\\[
m = 0 \implies \f{\dot E}{E} = -\f{\dot a}{a} \implies E(t) = \f{E(t\_0)}a,
\tag{2.31}
\\]
and for a non-relativistic massive particle,
\\[
E \simeq m \implies \dot E \simeq 0 \implies E(t) \simeq E(t\_0).
\\]
This demonstrates that only relativistic particles (i.e. radiation) lose significant energy through cosmological expansion.

### Energy of the medium

A similar method of analysis can be applied to the homogeneous, isotropic background of the universe, characterized by the mean energy density $\rho$ and the mean pressure $\mathcal P$. Its energy-momentum tensor is
\\[
\renewcommand{\P}{{\mathcal P}}
{T^\mu}\_\nu \to \begin{pmatrix}
-\rho & 0 & 0 & 0\\\
0 & \P & 0 & 0\\\
0 & 0 & \P & 0\\\
0 & 0 & 0 & \P
\end{pmatrix}
\tag{2.44}
\\] 
in the rest frame and obeys the conservation of local energy-momentum $\nabla\_\mu {T^\mu}\_\nu = 0$, whose $\nu=0$ component tells us that
\\[\begin{aligned}
0 &= \p\_\mu {T^\mu}\_0 + \Gamma^\mu\_{\alpha\mu}{T^\alpha}\_0 - \Gamma^\alpha\_{0\mu}{T^\mu}\_\alpha\\\
&= \p\_0 {T^0}\_0 + \Gamma^i\_{0i}{T^0}\_0 - \Gamma^i\_{0j}{T^j}\_i\\\
&= -\p\_t \rho - \delta^i\_i \f{\dot a}{a} \rho - \delta^i\_j \f{\dot a}{a} \delta^j\_i \mathcal P\\\
\iff 0&= \p\_t \rho + 3\f{\dot a}{a}\brk{ \rho + \mathcal P }\\\
\iff \f{\p\_t(\rho a^3)}{a^3} &= -3\f{\dot a}{a}\mathcal P.
\tag{2.57}
\end{aligned}\\]

In general, the density of a medium with a constant **equation of state** $w \equiv \mathcal P / \rho$ evolves as $\rho \propto a^{-3-3w}$. For radiation, $\mathcal P\_{\text r} \simeq \rho\_{\text r}/3 \implies \rho\_{\text r} \propto a^{-4}$, whereas for nonrelativistic matter, $\mathcal P\_{\text m} \simeq 0 \implies \rho\_{\text m} \propto a^{-3}$. The cosmological constant, with $w\_\Lambda = -1$, is thus constant through time.

### Distances and conformal time

In a small time interval $dt$, light travels a comoving distance $dx = dt/a$, thus the total comoving distance $\chi$ traversed by a light emitted at time $t$ (i.e. the comoving distance from us to an object we observe at time $t$) is 
\\[
\chi(t) = \int\_t^{t\_0} \f{\d t'}{a(t')} = \int\_{a(t)}^1 \f{\d a'}{a'^2 H(a')} = \int\_0^z \f{\d z'}{H(z')}.
\tag{2.34}
\\]
And the maximum comoving distance $\eta$ that may be causally connected to a point in time $t$ is 
\\[
\eta(t) \equiv \int\_0^t \f{\d t'}{a(t')}.
\tag{2.35}
\\]
This is also known as the **comoving horizon**, or as the **conformal time**, seeing it monotonically increases with $t$.

TODO: Angular sizes and curvature. For the time being, see [this xkcd comic](https://xkcd.com/2622/) for an illustration of this concept.

### Nonrelativistic distribution statistics

Many macroscopic statistics of a system are derived from how its particles are distributed in [phase-space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase\_space).
We can calculate this phase-space distribution using some quantum mechanics!

First, let us calculate how many particles there are within every infinitesimal phase-space volume $\d^3x\, \d^3p$:

[Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty\_principle)
tells us that every such volume contains
$\d^3 x\, \d^3 p/[2\pi]^3$
indivisible **fundamental phase-space elements**.
Then, the distribution function $f\_s(\vec x, \vec p, t)$ counts the number of particles of a given species $s$ per such element around $(\vec x, \vec p, t)$. 
However, $f\_s$ does not distinguish degenerate states, so we also have to multiply by the **degeneracy factor** $g\_s$. 
For example, photons have $g\_\gamma = 2$ due to their two spin states.

Thus, every infinitesimal volume $\d^3x\, \d^3p$ in phase-space contains
\\[
\f{\d^3 x \, \d^3 p}{[2\pi]^3} g\_s f\_s(\vec x, \vec p, t)
\\]
particles.

Consider some phase-space function $A\_s(\vec x, \vec p)$. 
Integrating it over the phase-space around $\vec x$, 
weighing with the number of particles per infinitesimal phase-space volume,
and dividing by the infinitesimal physical volume $\d x^3$,
we obtain its corresponding physical-space density
\\[\\begin{aligned}
\mathcal A\_s(\vec x, t) &= g\_s \int \f{\d^3 p}{[2\pi]^3}\, f\_s(\vec x, \vec p, t) A\_s(\vec x, \vec p).
\\end{aligned}\\]
(Dimensionally, 
this correspondence between phase-space total and physical-space density can be seen through the
$[\text{momentum}] = [\text{energy}] = [\text{time}]^{-1} = [\text{length}]^{-1}$
equivalence in natural units.)

Different phase-space functions $A\_s$ can tell us different microscopic properties of the species at $(\vec x, t)$. 
For instance, energy function $E\_s(p)$ gives the energy density
\\[
\rho\_s(\vec x, t) =  g\_s \int \f{\d^3 p}{[2\pi]^3} \, f\_s(\vec x, \vec p, t) \, E\_s(p),
\tag{2.62}
\\]
and the pressure-energy $\mathbb P\_s(p) = p^3/3E\_s(p)$ gives the pressure
\\[
\mathcal{P}\_s(\vec x, t) = g\_s \int \f{\d^3 p}{[2\pi]^3} \, f\_s(\vec x, \vec p, t) \, \f{p^2}{3E\_s(p)}.
\tag{2.64}
\\]

### Relativistic distribution statistics

To model relativistic particles, 
we have to convert the density and pressure scalar fields in [Nonrelativistic distribution statistics](#nonrelativistic-distribution-statistics) to a energy-momentum tensor field $T{^\mu}\_\nu(\vec x, t)$.
This is done by substituting the energy $E$ and physical momentum $\vec p$ in the above equations 
with the comoving momentum $P^\alpha = (E, \vec p/a)$ in a reference frame which flows locally with the particles. 
The comoving mass density is then
\\[
\rho\_s(\vec x, t)
= -\f{g\_s}{\sqrt{-|g|}} \int \f{\d^3 P}{[2\pi]^3} \f{P^0 P\_0}{P^0} f\_s(\vec x, \vec p, t),
\\]
while the comoving pressures are
\\[
\mathcal P(\vec x, t)\, \delta^i\_j
= \f{g\_s}{\sqrt{-|g|}} \int \f{\d^3 P}{[2\pi]^3} \f{P^i P\_j}{P^0} f\_s(\vec x, \vec p, t),
\\]
where $|g|$ is the determinant of the metric (for diagonal metrics such as the FLRW, $|g| = g\_{00} g\_{11} g\_{22} g\_{33}$),
and $\d^3 P \equiv \d P\_1 \d P\_2 \d P\_3$ is the comoving momentum's spatial volume element.
Together, they give the energy-momentum tensor
\\[
T{^\mu}\_\nu
= \f{g\_s}{-|g|} \int \f{\d^3 P}{[2\pi]^3} \f{P^\mu P\_\nu}{P^0} f(\vec x, \vec p, t).
\tag{3.20}
\\]
Since this is a tensor equation that holds true in a comoving reference frame, 
it must hold true for all reference frames.

### Species in thermal equilibrium

Under thermal equilibrium, 
the distribution function $f\_s$ for every species is only dependent on the momentum magnitude $p$ through the energy $E\_s(p) = \sqrt{p^2 + m\_s^2}$, 
with bosons following the **Bose--Einstein distribution**
\\[
f\_\text{BE}(E\_s) = \f1{e^{[E\_s - \mu\_s]/T} - 1}
\tag{2.65}
\\]
and fermions following the **Fermi--Dirac distribution**
\\[
f\_\text{FD}(E\_s) = \f1{e^{[E\_s - \mu\_s]/T} + 1},
\tag{2.66}
\\]
where $\mu\_s$ is the chemical potential and $T$ is the equilibrium temperature. 
For photons and neutrinos, $\mu\_{\text r} \ll T$.
Evaluating $\mathcal{P}\_{\text r}$ in thermal equilibrium thus gives
\\[
\f{\p\mathcal{P}\_{\text r}}{\p T} = \f{\rho\_{\text r} + \mathcal{P}\_{\text r}}{T} \propto a^{-3}.
\tag{2.67}
\\]
Thus the entropy density of the universe $S \equiv (\rho + \mathcal P)/T$ scales as $a^{-3}$ in thermal equilibrium.

### Cosmic inventory

Define the dimensionless **density parameter** of a species $s$ to be
\\[
\Omega\_s \equiv \f{\rho\_s(t\_0)}{\rho\_{\text{cr}}},
\tag{2.71}
\\]
i.e. its present-day density as a fraction of the universe’s critical density $\rho\_{\text{cr}}$, we can write the physical density as 
\\[
\rho\_s(a) = \Omega\_s \rho\_{\text{cr}} a^{-3[1 + w\_s]},
\tag{2.72}
\\]
where $a$ is the scale factor and $w\_s$ is the equation of state for $s$.

For photons ($g\_\gamma = 2, \mu\_\gamma \ll T, E\_\gamma(p) = p$), we have
\\[\begin{aligned}
\rho\_\gamma &= \f{2}{[2\pi]^3} \int \d^3 p \, \f{p}{e^{p/T} - 1}\\\
&= \f{2}{[2\pi]^3} \f{4\pi}3 \int\_0^\infty \d(p^3) \, \f{p}{e^{p/T} - 1}\\\
&= \f{8\pi}{[2\pi]^3} \int\_0^\infty \d p \, \f{p^3}{e^{p/T} - 1}\\\
&= \f{8\pi T^4}{[2\pi]^3} \int\_0^\infty \d u \, \f{u^3}{e^{u} - 1}\\\
&= \f{8\pi T^4}{[2\pi]^3} \, 3!\zeta(4)\\\
&= \f{\pi^2}{15} T^4
\tag{2.75}
\end{aligned}\\]
where the **Riemann Zeta function**
\\[\begin{aligned}
\zeta(n) &\equiv \sum\_{j=1}^\infty \f1{j^n} \\\
&= \f1{[n-1]!} \int\_0^\infty \d x \f{x^{n-1}}{e^x - 1}\\\
&= \f1{[n-1]![1 - 2^{1-n}]} \int\_0^\infty \d x \f{x^{n-1}}{e^x + 1},
\tag{C.29}
\end{aligned}\\]
with $\zeta(4) = \pi^4/90$.
This lets us calculate the present-day photon density parameter
\\[
\Omega\_\gamma = 2.47 \times 10^{-5} h^{-2}
\\]
from the present-day temperature of the CMB. This is very insignificant.

Because $\rho\_{\text r} \propto a^{-4}$ [(2.57)](#tag-2.57), the temperature of photon radiation must scale as $a^{-1}$. Since $E\_{\text r}$ also scales as $a^{-1}$ [(2.31)](#tag-2.31), the equilibrium photon distribution function is unaffected by the cosmic expansion. Note that in reality, there are small perturbations around this equilibrium, corresponding to anisotropies in the CMB.

Baryons (i.e. nucleons and electrons), on the other hand, come in many different phases (e.g. diffuse gas, ionized plasma, compact objects, etc.) throughout cosmic history, thus cannot be modeled by an equilibrium distribution. 
Instead, their density parameter is estimated with methods such as starcounting, mapping of the intergalactic medium, comparisons of light elements abundances, and measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs). 
Elemental abundances and BAO measurements constrains the present-day baryon density parameter to
\\[
\Omega\_{\text b} = 0.0222(5) h^{-2},\, 0.0225(3) h^{-2}
\\]
respectively. Thus $\rho\_{\text b} \simeq 0.05\rho\_{\text{cr}}$, hinting a significant amount of non-baryonic matter.
