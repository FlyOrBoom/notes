## 0. Notation
 
- **Natural units**: $\hbar = c = k_B = 1$. 
- **Vectors**: 3-vectors are bolded $\vec p$. 4-vectors are represented by their components $P^\mu$.
- **Tensor indices**: Upper indices are contravariant. Lower indices are covariant.
- **Metric signature**: -- + + +.
- **Einstein summation**: Repeated indices are implicitly summed over. Latin indices range $1,2,3$. Greek indices range $0,1,2,3$.
- **Dot time derivative**: $\dot x \equiv \d x/\d t$.
- **Partial derivatives**: $\partial_\mu \equiv \partial/\partial x^\mu$. For instance, $\partial_\mu x^\nu = \delta_\mu^\nu$.
