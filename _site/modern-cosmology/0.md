## 0. Notation
 
- **Natural units**: $\hbar = c = k\_B = 1$. 
- **Vectors**: Physical vectors are bolded $\vec p$. Relativistic/comoving vectors (and higher-rank tensors) are represented by their components $P^\mu$.
- **Tensor indices**: Upper indices are contravariant. Lower indices are covariant.
- **Metric signature**: ${-} {+} {+} {+}$.
- **Einstein summation**: Repeated indices are implicitly summed over. Latin indices range $1,2,3$. Greek indices range $0,1,2,3$.
- **Partial derivatives**: $\partial_\mu \equiv \partial/\partial x^\mu$. For instance, $\partial_\mu x^\nu = \delta_\mu^\nu$.
- **Dot time derivative**: $\dot x \equiv \p\_0 x = \p x/\p t$.
- **Species subscripts**: $s$ stands for any constituent species of the universe,
$\text m$ for all matter, and $\Lambda$ for dark energy. 
Of the matter: $\text c$ for cold dark matter and $\text b$ for baryons.
Of the baryons: $\gamma$ for photons, $\nu$ for neutrinos, $\text r$ for radiation ($\gamma$ and early $\nu$).
- **Brackets**: Parentheses $f(\cdots)$ evaluate terms with a function or operator on the left side; Square brackets $[\cdots]$ group terms together, or evaluate functions with a functional $C[\cdots]$.
- **Equalities**: $\equiv$ is by definition. $\simeq$ is to first-order approximation (e.g. $\sin x\simeq x$). $\to$ projects tensor components (e.g., $\p\_i \to \nabla$).
